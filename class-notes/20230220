	
	Data Structure:
		- An organisation of data.
		- So that data may be processed efficiently
		
	
	Primitive:
		int, float, char
	
	Non-Primitive
		Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue, Tree, Graph
		
	Linear
		Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue
	Non-Linear
		Tree, Graph
		
	Operation on DS:
		1. Traversal (Visiting)
		2. Insert
		3. Delete
		4. Sort
		5. Search
		6. Merge
		
	
	Representation of stack using:
		a. array
		b. linked list
		
		
	Limitation of array: Finite
		- Cannot be resized during runtime
		
	This limition was conquered by use of linked list.
	
	Stack and Queue are list with limited operations:
	
		In Stack insertion as well as deletion takes place at top.
		LIFO: Last In First Out
			Insert operation here is called PUSH.
			Deletion operation here is called POP.
			
		In Queue insertion takes place at rear and deletion at front
		FIFO: First In First Out
			Insertion operation here is called EnQueue
			Deletion operation here is called DeQueue
	
		Double Ended Queue
		
		
		Maintenance
